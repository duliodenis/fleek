# fleek
fleek is a location-based social iOS app designed to help people discover what they want to do together.

fleek will play an active role in helping you discover and navigate the world around you. Contrary to on-demand location discovery which requires active participation (Yelp, Google Maps, etc.), fleek will alert you when you're near places of interest even when the app is closed.

At any given moment, there are dozens if not hundreds of restaurants, museums, bars, beaches and theaters you may like to check out. Wouldn't it be great if you could save these for later and have your phone notify you if and when you get close to one?

### User Stories

The project's eight user stories are:

| Story        | Name           | Description  |
| :-------------: |-------------| -----| ----|
| 1      | Query | As a user, I want to query Apple Maps for POI (points of interest). |
| 2      | Save | As a user, I want to save my POI for later. |
| 3      | Categories | As a user, I want to be able to view and create categories each with a name and color (from a list of colors). |
| 4      | Assignment | As a user, I want to be able to assign my POI to a category. |
| 5      | Filter | As a user, I want to filter my POI based on category. |
| 6      | Notes | As a user, I want to be able to add notes to any POI, as well as navigate to it or share it. |
| 7      | Notifications | As a user, I want to be notified if/when I approach my POI. |
| 8      | Delete | As a user, I want to be able to delete any POI or Category. |

These are ordered with core functionality at the top, and additional features towards the bottom. That is, some later stories rely on the completion of the initial stories.
